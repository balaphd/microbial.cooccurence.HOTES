### Title
Microbial co-occurrence network patterns in moisture damaged homes in Finland.
#Abstract

### Introduction


Previous knowledge (moisture damage microbial signatures upon damage vs renovation)


Knowledge gap (details missing on the interaction of microbes in the environment compared and also we dont know whether the interaction changes after renovation)

The main objective of the paper is to construct microbial co-occurrence network and identify signature co-occurence patterns in moisture damaged homes in Finland. Some of the specific aims include:

(1) how the microbes interacts between themself or with one another in moisture damaged environments 
(2) how the interaction is between different microbial kingdoms - Bacteria and Fungi in moistute damaged environments 
(3) Does the global and local network properties of microbial co-occurence network were unique to moisture damage and does it changes after renovation 
(4) What/How does the identified signatures in HOTES paper (first one) placed/explained in the microbial co-occurence network (5) Does renovation has an effect on the interaction of microbes with this signature microbes (from first paper) in the network? 
(6) Is it possible to identify signature co-occurence microbes specific to moisture damaged environment?

### Methods

- Constructing microbial co-occurence network from moisture damaged homes
- Constructing microbial co-occurence network from renovated homes
- Calculate the global and local prop[erties in each networks and compare them
- Doing the same with Fungal data too
- Constructing network combining both Bacteria and Fungi
- Doing the same with the combined network
- Locate the signature sequences in all the networks constructed

The otu table was splitted for moisture damaged samples only and renovated only.

Preliminary steps were 
- the OTU table was filtered for only closed reference OTUs only. The reasoning behind this is to address the problem regarding the denovo otu picking done by open reference approach. Since denovo otu picking is not robust as closed reference OTUIDs.

#TITLE
Microbial co-occurrence network patterns in moisture damaged homes in Finland.
#Abstract

#Introduction

Previous knowledge (moisture damage microbial signatures upon damage vs renovation)
Knowledge gap (details missing on (1) how the microbes interacts between themself or with one another in moisture damaged environments (2) how the interaction is between different microbial kingdoms - Bacteria and Fungi in moistute damaged environments (3) Does the global and local network properties of microbial co-occurence network were unique to moisture damage and does it changes after renovation (4) What/How does the identified signatures in HOTES paper (first one) placed/explained in the microbial co-occurence network (5) Does renovation has an effect on the interaction of microbes with this signature microbes (from first paper) in the network? (6) Is it possible to identify signature co-occurence microbes specific to moisture damaged environment?
